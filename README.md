# resistor-wizard-react
This is a react project created in order to attend the class of "Oficinas de Integração 1" at Universidade Tecnológica Federal do Paraná, Computer Engineering Course.

# Who am I ? 
My name is Matheus Passos. I'm 20 years old and I'm a fullstack software development intern. I'm looking for continuous improvement and that's why I chose to learn the most requested technologies in the market, such as React. At the time of this Readme update, I have solid experiences with Java, VueJS, CouchDB, PostgreSQL, Cordova and other frameworks. Also, I worked with Linux and Docker. I hope this simple project becomes something more advanced and that you can follow my evolution!
